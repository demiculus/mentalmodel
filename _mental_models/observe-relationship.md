### Description

Most of our relationships form organically. We rarely sit down and consciously evaluate what we are gaining from them. Sometimes we stay close to someone simply because of familiarity — even when the relationship may be unhealthy or misaligned. On the other hand, when asked why we like someone, we often struggle to explain it. The reason is usually not one big thing, but the sum of a thousand small things. Those small things are often what our subconscious believes we need at that point in time.

Another important idea: every relationship has an ideal proximity. Getting too close to certain people can be harmful. We may be able to share specific parts of our life with someone, but not others. For example, someone we get along with very well may not be an ideal housemate or business partner. Someone we love may not necessarily be our ideal long-term companion.

This practice improves your ability to intentionally surround yourself with the right people — at the right level of closeness.

### Practice: 

1. Write down the name of the person you want to observe.
2. Describe their personality.
3. Write what you like about them.
4. Write what you don’t like about them.
5. Note how often you see them and in what context.
6. Describe how you feel when you spend time with them.
7. Define the ideal way you would like to spend time with them.
