#### Description

Scientists have found that gratitude stimulates pathways in the brain involved in feelings of reward, forming social bonds, and interpreting others’ intentions.

It also makes it easier to store and retrieve positive memories.

Additionally, gratitude directly counteracts negative feelings and traits such as envy, social comparison, narcissism, cynicism, and materialism.

As a consequence, people who practice gratitude consistently tend to be happier and more satisfied.

They have better relationships, find it easier to make friends, sleep better, tend to suffer less from depression, addiction, and burnout, and are better at coping with traumatic events.

In a way, gratitude makes it less likely that you’ll fall into the psychological traps modern life has set for you.

For example, gratitude measurably counters the tendency to forget or downplay positive events. If you work long and hard for something, finally achieving it can feel surprisingly empty. You may find yourself emotionally back where you started, chasing the next big goal and seeking satisfaction externally instead of feeling satisfied with yourself.

Or imagine being lonely and wanting more friends. You might already have one or more people who want to hang out with you, but still feel that it’s not enough, judge yourself harshly, and feel bad about yourself. As a result, you might turn down their invitations and become even more lonely.

If you feel grateful for your relationships instead, you might accept invitations or even take the initiative yourself. The more often you risk opening up, the higher the chance of strengthening existing relationships and meeting new people.

In the best case, gratitude can trigger a positive feedback loop. Positive feelings lead to more prosocial behavior, which leads to more positive social experiences, creating even more positive feelings. This is a common experience after serious hardship, such as chemotherapy.

Life can feel extraordinarily meaningful after a crisis is over. The smallest things can become bottomless sources of joy, from being able to taste food, to sitting in the sun, or simply chatting with a friend

#### Practice

Every morning, write three different sentences about what you are grateful for.

You can use the following 4 items to guide you; 

- An old relationship that had a positive impact on you
- An opportunity that you have today
- Something great that happened or that you noticed yesterday
- A simple thing near you (tap water, the pen you’re holding, etc.)


#### Examples

- Good colleagues
- Some time alone to relax and unwind
- Being alive
- Having someone who loves me
- Having someone I love
- My laptop
- Having plenty of food
- My health
- A warm bed
- The person who sent me this
- Even feeling hate — being able to feel something at all :)
