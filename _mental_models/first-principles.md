#### Description

First principles thinking is a problem-solving method that involves breaking down complex problems into their most fundamental components and then rebuilding solutions from the ground up.

A common approach is making small, incremental improvements to existing solutions, often referred to as _analogous thinking_. While quick, this approach is often less effective and less adaptable than solutions developed from First Principles.

Example: A restaurant owner might want to reduce the amount of food served to increase profit margins. A first-principles thinker would ask “Why?” and realize that the real goal is to increase profit. They would then explore alternative ways to achieve the same outcome, such as automating part of the workforce or importing materials from lower-cost suppliers.




#### Practice

1. Identify the problem or challenge at hand and the assumptions commonly associated with it.
2. Break the problem down into its fundamental components or principles. This may involve challenging assumptions and thinking critically about the problem.
3. Build solutions based on these core principles.
4. Test, evaluate, and refine the solutions.


#### Practice 1

Step 1. Identify the problem or task you are facing

Step 2. Break down the problem or task into smaller parts

Step 3. Gather enough information about each of the parts

Step 4. Think about how the parts fit together.

Step 5. Choose the best solution and try it out.


#### Example-1

1. **Identify the problem**: "I want to lose weight"
2. **Break it into smaller parts:** Nutrition, exercise, and sleep
3. **Gather information about each parts:** 

_Nutrition:_ "How much am I eating? How many calories should I consume to lose weight? What types of food should I eat?"

_Exercise_: "What types of physical activity do I enjoy? How much physical activity am I getting?"

_Sleep_: "How much sleep am I getting? Am I getting good quality of sleep? Are there any changes I can make to improve my sleep?"

4. **Think about how the parts fit together**: "How can I create a plan that combines nutrition, exercise, and sleep to help me lose weight?"
5. **Choose the best solution and try it out:** "I will start by tracking my food intake, walking for 30 minutes each day, and getting 7–8 hours of sleep each night."


#### Example-2

1. **Identify the problem:** "I want to save money on my monthly grocery bill."
2. **Break it into smaller parts:** "What makes up my grocery bill, and how can I reduce the cost of each component?"
3. **Understand each part indivdually:** "What are the most cost-effective sources of protein, carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables? Which items are essential, and which can I do without? What is the best way to buy in bulk or take advantage of sales and discounts?"
4. **Think about how the parts fit together:** "How can I create a grocery list and meal plan that meets my nutritional needs and budget? How can I balance buying in bulk and stocking up on sale items with avoiding waste and spoilage?"
5. **Choose the best solution and try it out:** "I will plan my meals and grocery list based on cost-effective nutrient sources, buy in bulk when appropriate, and take advantage of sales and discounts on essential items. I will also avoid unnecessary purchases and be mindful of food waste and spoilage."
