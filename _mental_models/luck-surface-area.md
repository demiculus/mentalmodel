## Description

The amount of serendipity that occurs in your life — your _Luck Surface Area_ — is directly proportional to how intensely you pursue something you’re passionate about, combined with how effectively you communicate it to others. It’s a simple concept, but an extremely powerful one. What it implies is that you can directly influence the amount of luck you experience. In other words, you can make your own luck. Luck increases when you consistently do meaningful work and share it with the right people. [source](https://www.codusoperandi.com/posts/increasing-your-luck-surface-area)

## Practice

### Method 1

**From doing:**
Think of something you are currently doing.
  - How much energy are you putting into doing that thing?
  - How much energy are you putting into talking about that thing?
  - Which one should you increase or decrease to maximize your _Luck Surface Area_?
  - What are ways I can do more doing/talking?

### Method 2

**From telling:**

Think of something you are already talking about or sharing
  - How much energy are you putting into actually doing that thing?
  - How much energy are you putting into talking about it?
  - Which one should you increase or decrease to maximize your _Luck Surface Area_?
  - What are ways I can do more doing/talking?

### Example-1

**Doing**: Working on my game

**Doing Energy:** 10

**Telling Energy:** 1

I should increase my telling to expand my Luck Surface Area.

Ways I can increase my talking:
  - Stream on Twitch while working and add a button on my website where players can watch me develop the game.
  - Write blog posts about what we’re building and how we’re building it.

### Example-2

**Doing**: Breakdance

**Doing Energy**: 10

**Telling Energy:** 0

I should start telling people about it.

Ways I can increase my telling:
  - Post Instagram, Facebook, or WhatsApp stories when I practice.

  - Write blog posts about what I’ve learned during practice and share them in relevant subreddits.
