## Description

The “Hourly Rate Principle” is a decision-making framework for managing your time based on the value you generate in one hour of work. It suggests using your actual hourly earnings as a reference point when deciding between alternative activities that require different amounts of time (e.g., commuting by taxi or bus).

## Practice

1. Determine your actual hourly earnings. This could come from your job or any income-generating activity.
2. Identify and write down situations where you can choose a more expensive option that takes  `T1` minutes instead of a cheap alternative that will take `T2` > `T1` minutes.
3. Calculate the potential value of the time difference between the two options. For example, if you earn $100 per hour and one option saves you 30 minutes, that represents a potential value of $50.
4. Compare this potential value to the additional cost of the more expensive option. If the extra cost is less than the potential value of the time saved, the more expensive option may be the better choice.
5. Keep track of these decisions and their outcomes over time. This can provide useful insights and help refine your decision-making process.
6. Balance the monetary perspective with non-monetary factors that matter to you, such as stress levels, health benefits, personal satisfaction, or environmental impact.

### Example-1: Commuting

Suppose you earn $100 per hour. Your commute options are:

1. A bus that takes 60 minutes
2. A taxi that takes 30 minutes

If the taxi costs less than $50, choosing it would be beneficial according to the Hourly Rate Principle. The 30 minutes saved could be spent working, generating a potential $50 (half your hourly rate). However, if the taxi costs more than $50, the bus may be the better choice because the money saved outweighs the potential value of the time saved.

### Example-2: Outsourcing Tasks

Suppose you run a side business and spend significant time on administrative tasks that could be outsourced. If you earn:

1. $100 per hour on your main work
2. and you can hire $25 per hour for a virtual assistant to handle administrative tasks

The Hourly Rate Principle suggests outsourcing those tasks and dedicating your time to higher-value work.

### Example-3: Meal Preparation vs. Ordering Food

1. If meal preparation takes two hours and you earn $100 per hour, that represents a $200 opportunity cost (excluding ingredients).
2. If you can order a healthy meal for less than this amount, it may be worth considering, freeing your time for higher-value work or meaningful activities.

### Example-4: DIY Home Repair vs. Hiring a Professional

1. If a home repair takes six hours and you could otherwise earn $100 per hour, that represents a $600 opportunity cost.
2. If hiring a professional costs less than this amount, it may be more cost-effective and time-efficient to do so.

### Example-5: Self-learning vs. Taking a Course

Suppose you need to learn a new skill for work:

1. If learning independently takes 50 hours, that represents a $5,000 opportunity cost at a $100 hourly rate.
2. If a course costs less and significantly reduces the learning time, the Hourly Rate Principle suggests it may be a better investment.

#### Note

The Hourly Rate Principle is a decision-making tool. While it can guide you toward a more efficient use of your time, it should be used alongside other factors that contribute to your overall well-being.
