## Practice

#### Method 1:

1. Think of something you will do today, this week, or this month.
2. Think about what you’re trying to accomplish.
3. Multiply that goal by 100.
4. Ask yourself, _“What are some ways I could achieve 100× that goal?”_

**Method 2:**

1. Define your 10-year goal.
2. Write down all the ways you could achieve it in six months.

**Method 3:** 

1. Think of a small goal.
2. Identify the limitations you’re telling yourself that prevent you from achieving it.
3. Repeat this three times: _“These limitations are not universal; they exist only in my head. They are excuses for not achieving my goal. I will stop believing them.”_

### Method 1

**Example 1**

1. I will give a presentation next week.
2. My goal is to increase my Luck Surface Area by telling people what I’m working on.
3. Instead of reaching 20 people, I could reach 2,000.
4. Ways I could reach 2,000 people:
    1. Give the presentation at a larger event.
    2. Turn the presentation into a blog post and share it in relevant communities.
    3. Get featured on a YouTube talk show.
    4. Contact podcasters and pitch myself as a guest.

**Example 2**

1. Hire a marketer.
2. Delegate or outsource our marketing tasks.
3. How could we get the most willing and hardworking marketers to work with us for free?
4. What are ways we could attract hundreds of highly motivated marketers to contribute for free?
    1. Build a gamified system where users can write Catan-related posts on our forums and earn rewards, status, and recognition.
    2. Create a system where users bring in new players and mentor them one by one.
    3. Design our marketing and social media structure so that it is community-run. The community creates posts, votes on them, and the top posts are automatically published on social media. We simply set the rules.

### Method 2 

**Example**

1. My 10-year goal is to create a billion-dollar company.
2. Ways I could move toward it in six months:
	1. Secure significant investment.
	2. Connect with the most experienced and knowledgeable people in the field — email them, call them, or fly out to meet them.
	3. Connect with enthusiasts in my field and get them involved in the project.


### Method 3 

**Example**

1. Goal: Perform a flare in breakdancing.
2. Limitations: I need to be stronger and more flexible to do it.
3. The belief that I must be stronger and more flexible to perform a flare may not be universally true. These thoughts may be excuses that prevent me from taking action. I will stop believing these limitations. I may be able to perform a flare sooner than I think by experimenting and practicing creatively.
