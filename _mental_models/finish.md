#### Description

This is an evolved form of the “Next Steps” model: https://mmpractices.com/mental_models/next-step/

When we contact our superior with an issue or update, we should have the full plan laid out. He shouldn’t be asking questions like “So?” or “What’s next?”. All the “what” questions should already be answered. He should instead be asking questions to better understand, such as `why..` `how..`. Or telling you to move forward with it. 


#### Practice

1. Write down one thing you contacted your boss about.
2. Write down the full execution strategy and how you would present it to your boss.

#### Example-1

_Bad Employee_: It is hard for me to test these A/B tests because I have to create a new account. 

_Manager_: So? What do you want me to do? Why not solve your problem?

_Bad Employee2:_ It is hard for me to test these abtests. Can you create a task for devs so they can implement a feature where I can change my abtests?

_Manager_: Why don’t you create it?

_Good Employee_: It is hard for me to test these A/B tests, so I created a task for the devs to implement a feature that allows me to easily change them.

_Manager_: 👍


#### Example-2

_Bad Employee:_ You shouldn’t post such things to Reddit.

_Manager:_ What things? There are four posts there.

_Good Employee:_ You shouldn’t post this to Reddit: `url of post`. The other three posts are fine. You should:
  1. Delete this post: `url of post`
  2. In the future, don’t write [specific type of comment].
     
_Manager:_ Ok, I deleted the bad post.


#### Example-3

_Bad employee:_ We cannot ship this to your location

_Manager:_ Then what should I do? 

_Good Employee:_ Shipping is not possible to your location. However, there's an option for us to hire a 3rd party delivery service. It's more expensive, but delivery is guaranteed. 

If you’re able to answer the “what’s next?” along with all the “what” items in the initial report, this will help avoid further back-and-forth with your superior and give the impression that you’re an effective employee.
