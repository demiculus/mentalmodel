## Description

I often say “yes” because I don’t want to seem rude. When I say “no,” I worry that the other person will feel bad. In many cases, saying “yes” feels easier in the moment. It avoids tension and keeps things smooth.

However, constantly saying “yes” can create long-term problems. It can lead to burnout, resentment, and frustration. Sometimes you may even agree to something you cannot realistically handle.

Being able to say “no” protects your time, energy, and mental health. It also improves your long-term decision-making. Every “yes” is a commitment. If you say “yes” to everything, you lose control over your own priorities.

Learning to say “no” is not about being unkind — it is about setting boundaries.

### Practice 1 - Reminiscence

1. Make sure you are relaxed and not overwhelmed by strong emotions. 
2. Recall one experience where you said “yes” to an external request.
3. Write down three possible outcomes that could have happened if you had said “no.”
4. Choose the best alternative outcome.
5. Rewrite your “no” response in a polite and positive way.

### Practice 2 - Simulation

1. Imagine a friend asking you for something.
2. Visualize yourself calmly saying “no.”

These simulations are meant to strengthen your “no” muscle. Be bold in your imagination. The goal is not cruelty — it is comfort with boundary-setting.

### Example 1

I imagine walking down the street in a relaxed mood. An elderly woman asks me to carry her bags.

I imagine saying, “I’m sorry, I’m in a hurry.” Whether I truly am or not doesn’t matter for the exercise. I imagine her saying “Okay,” and asking the next person for help.

### Example 2

I imagine browsing the internet during my rest time. A friend texts me asking me to fix something immediately.

I imagine replying, “I’m exhausted today and taking some time to rest. I’ll look at it tomorrow.”

### Example 3

I imagine my sister asking me to check the food in 10 minutes while I am deeply focused.

I imagine responding, “I’m concentrating right now. You’ll need to find another way to handle it.”

### Tips On Saying No

1. Be concise and express your feelings without feeling guilty.
2. People can understand you if you are kind and reasonable. If you explain why you’re saying “no,” it might change the whole situation. It can also help you maintain your relationship with that person.
3. It’s okay to say, “I need some space” or “I’m unable to participate.” There’s nothing wrong with that.

Most people can understand a reasonable boundary when it is communicated respectfully. If helpful, briefly explain your reason. That can maintain trust and preserve the relationship.
