## Description

### Step 1: Select a Challenging Task, Goal, or Situation

Some examples might be:

- You are repeatedly procrastinating (e.g., finishing a paper).
- Others are frustrated because you haven’t handled something yet.
- You haven’t had the courage to act (e.g., pursuing an idea).
- Your energy drains just thinking about it (e.g., meetings).

For this example, we’ll use **losing weight.**

### Step 2: Select one of the motivational outlook

**Disinterested**
> I see no value in losing 25 pounds. I may not be pleased with my weight or diet, but I have no intention of acting on this goal — it feels too overwhelming right now.

**External**
>  I really want to win the prize our health insurance company is offering if I achieve my weight-loss goal over the next six months.

**Imposed**
> I feel a lot of pressure to lose weight. My family members are worried about my health, and I feel guilty about disappointing them.

**Aligned**
> I value my health, and losing weight is one way to honor that value. I look forward to losing twenty-five pounds. It is a healthy choice for me.

**Integrated**
> Part of my life purpose is to be a role model for my children and to have the energy to be involved in their lives. Losing twenty-five pounds will give me the vitality I need to fulfill that purpose.

**Inherent**
> I am genuinely enthusiastic about losing weight. This new diet sounds fun and exciting. I enjoy trying new approaches.

### Step 3: Answer the following questions

**Is your need for autonomy satisfied?**
- _Example_: Not being able to eat whatever I want decreases my sense of autonomy.
  
**Is your need for relatedness satisfied?**
- _Example_: Potential shame from family and friends lowers the quality of my connection with them.
  
**Is your need for competence satisfied?**
- _Example_: Pressure from my doctor and family makes me feel like they don’t trust my ability to take care of myself.

**Are you using mindfulness to self-regulate?**
- _Example_: When I eat food I “shouldn’t” eat, I avoid thinking about it — which reduces mindfulness.
  
**Are you using values to self-regulate?** 
- _Example_: I use integrity and loyalty to guide me at work, but I don’t see how those values connect to my eating habits.
  
**Are you using purpose to self-regulate?**
- _Example_: I’m not sure how becoming healthier connects to my larger life purpose.

### Step 4: Select the Motivational Outlook to Shift Toward

**Aligned**: First, clarify your values. Take the [values test](https://personalvalu.es/personal-values-test). Then connect your goal to those values.
- _Example_: I am a respectful person, and I respect my body. I will choose to be healthy as a way of honoring that respect.
  
**Integrated**: Clarify your life purpose. Then tie your goal to that purpose.
- _Example_: I aim to create a happy and healthy family. To do that, I need to stay well and avoid preventable illness. Losing weight supports that mission.
  
**Inherent**: Think back to your childhood and identify activities where you lost track of time and felt deep enjoyment. Then connect those elements to your goal.
- _Example_: As a child, I loved optimizing numbers and tracking stats. If I approach weight loss as a game — creating spreadsheets to track food, hunger, and calories — I can “min-max” my diet like a strategy challenge.

### Step 5: Practice mindfullness

- Take two minutes to reflect on the situation.
- Ask yourself:
    - What am I feeling?
    - What do I want to do?
    - Why do I want to do it?
- Use the [5whys](https://mmpractices.com/mental_models/5-whys/). Over time, you may realize that you already possess autonomy, relatedness, and competence — but they need to be consciously activated.

### Step 6: Reflect

Think about your goal again and write down what you [feel](https://media.thechalkboardmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/29212018/feelings-wheel-explained.jpg). You are looking for signs such as:

  - Positive energy
  - A sense of physical and emotional harmony
  - Calmness from supportive and secure relationships
  - Little to no negative energy, stress, or anxiety
  - A sense of continued learning, growth, and accomplishment
  - A feeling that you are contributing to something meaningful
