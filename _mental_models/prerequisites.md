### Description

This is one reason why many self-help books fail to help most readers.

Everything in life has prerequisites.

If someone wants to learn basic arithmetic, they must first understand numbers.

If someone wants to start a startup, they need sufficient financial runway.

The reason something isn’t working is almost **always** that the prerequisites are missing.

For example, if someone wants to lose weight but lacks the necessary foundations, advice will “bounce off” them most of the time. Until the prerequisites are fulfilled, progress will be inconsistent or unsustainable.

Instead of forcing the outcome, focus on building the conditions that make the outcome inevitable.

### Practice

1. Determine a specific goal.
2. Write down all the prerequisites required to achieve that goal.
3. Ask friends, mentors, or peers to help identify prerequisites you may be missing.


#### Example-1

**Goal**: _Gaining Muscle_

**Prerequisites**
 - A strong psychological reason to gain muscle
 - Enough time scheduled for workouts
 - Knowledge of how to train effectively
 - Access to equipment or facilities
 - Proper nutrition

If one of these is missing, progress will stall. Instead of worrying about gaining muscle, focus on fulfilling the prerequisites. Once they are in place, muscle gain becomes a natural result.

#### Example-2

**Goal:** _Getting a Better Job_

**Prerequisites**
- Clarity on what type of job you actually want
- Relevant skills for that role
- A strong resume and LinkedIn profile
- Interview preparation
- A consistent application process

If you lack clarity, skills, or preparation, applying to hundreds of jobs won’t help.
Instead of stressing about rejection, build the missing prerequisites. When they are fulfilled, opportunities increase significantly.

#### Example-3

**Goal:** _Improving a Romantic Relationship_

**Prerequisites**
- Emotional self-awareness
- Communication skills
- Willingness from both partners
- Time and space for meaningful conversations
- Personal emotional stability

If one partner lacks emotional regulation or communication skills, relationship advice won’t stick.
Instead of trying to “fix” the relationship directly, build the foundational skills first. Once the prerequisites are in place, the relationship improves more naturally.
