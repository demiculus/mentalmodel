#### Description

If you’re someone who, when you get a 2-minute break, immediately checks social media or starts playing games, this practice may be helpful for you. 

In this practice, we will train your mind in two key skills:

1. Identifying your dopamine hit
2. Identifying your replacement dopamine hit

Unhealthy dopamine hits can come in many forms. For example, I like going on [Colonist.io](https://colonist.io), [tetr.io](https://tetr.io), or playing a quick game of [chess](https://www.chess.com). Some people default to social media like Instagram or TikTok. Others default to porn sites, messaging platforms, dating apps, news sites, or eating. Note that not all dopamine hits are unhealthy.

Being aware of what we’re doing is the first step. We don’t necessarily need to change our behavior at this stage, but simply noticing it while it’s happening is a required skill. 

Replacing your dopamine hit can also take many forms. Some people find it easier to meditate, while others prefer journaling. Here are a few examples to give you a better idea of where you can start. Planning your next tasks, using a hand gripper, organizing, cleaning, stretching, or drinking water.

Note that this exercise is only meant to improve your identification skills. As you do this exercise, you’ll see that you get better and better at finding the ideal replacement.

#### Practice

1. Identify moments where you received a dopamine hit
2. Identify the ideal dopamine replacement for that scenario


#### Example-1

1. While my code is compiling, I start playing [tetr.io](https://tetr.io). The code finishes compiling in 2 minutes, but I play Tetr for 10.
2. Ideally, I should list all the next steps and checks I’m going to do after the code finishes compiling instead of going through them organically.

#### Example-2

1. I’ve finished work and everything for the day, don’t have anything to do, and feel tired. I default to porn or TikTok for the rest of the day.
2. I can sit on the floor, start stretching in a comfortable position, and close my eyes.

#### Example-3

1. I’ve finished all the messages I needed to reply to on Discord/Slack. I switch apps and then find myself playing a game of [tetr.io](https://tetr.io).
2. Writing or checking a to-do list hasn’t worked before. It doesn’t match the dopamine I get from Tetr. Instead, I stretch my arms until I know what I need to do (kind of like being physically hostage — forced meditation).
