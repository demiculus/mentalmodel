#### Description

Everything has a default state and requires energy to move it away from that default state. Energy is also required to establish a new default state. Additionally, energy is required to maintain the system in its desired state. Sometimes, this energy can be outsourced.
 
Example: A relationship’s default state is non-existent. If left alone, the relationship will naturally migrate back to its default state. 

Example: A company’s default state is non-existent. If left alone, the company will also migrate back to its default state.

Example: Weddings transfer part of the energy requirement from the couple to society and legal systems. Thus, marriage decreases the minimum energy required to keep the relationship going. In other words, it increases the amount of energy required to end the relationship.

#### Practice

1. Think of something you plan to do today or this week.
2. What is the goal of that action?
3. What would be the default state of this situation if no energy were applied?
4. What factors decrease or increase the amount of energy needed for the system to function?

#### Example-1

1. I will go to the gym and work out.
2. Goals: 
	- Heal my wrists
	- Have better-looking shoulders
	- Be able to perform advanced movements
3. Default state: I don’t push myself and fail to achieve the three goals above.
4. Factors that decrease or increase the energy required to achieve these goals:
	- Dec: Paying for a trainer decreases the amount of energy I spend to achieve my goals
	- Dec: Having a training schedule decreases the energy I spend each session
	- Dec: Having close friends at the gym decreases the energy required to go
	- Inc: The farther the gym is from my house, the more energy it requires to go

Dec (Actions that decrease energy usage)

Inc (Actions that increase energy usage)
