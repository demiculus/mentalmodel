#### Description

Desires can be categorized in many ways, but a fundamental distinction is between external and internal sources.

An external desire is derived from outside sources and often ceases to exist once that source is removed. Internal desires usually take decades to form; therefore, they are not expected to fade easily. Each desire has a trigger; when encountered, the desire is activated.

Knowing where a desire originates helps us gain control over our decisions.

Pursuing internal desires is generally more effective than external ones due to the compounding effect. An external desire might fade, leaving us resenting our work, whether it is a job, a hobby, or a business. By understanding these sources, we can intentionally place ourselves in situations where we are exposed to specific triggers, ensuring a beneficial desire continues.

#### Practice

1. Write down a desire you currently have.
2. List all the possible sources from which you could have obtained that desire.
3. Identify factors or changes that might make the desire dissipate.

#### Example 1

Goal: Creating a Shopify startup in Singapore.
Source: Seeing an "auntie" having a hard time selling her food via WhatsApp.
Fade Factor: When I stop interacting with her, my desire to solve that specific problem goes away.

#### Example 2

Goal: Creating dance videos.
Source: Watching my friends' dance videos on Instagram and TikTok.
Fade Factor: When I unfollow those friends, my desire to create similar content goes away.
