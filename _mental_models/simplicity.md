## Description

_["Everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler" - Unknown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ibabROYccs&feature=youtu.be&t=1149)_

The quote explains it well. If something can be done in a simpler way without removing any essential attribute, it should be simplified.

In game development, this is often described as depth versus complexity. A game becomes better when complexity is reduced while depth remains the same. An article improves when fewer words communicate the same meaning. A function is better when it does one simple thing well. An idea is stronger when it is easily understood.

There are a few ways to make something simpler. 

**1. Remove parts of it**

This works very well with writing. After you finish an article, go over it again and try removing words or sentences. If the meaning stays the same, continue removing more until you cannot remove anything without reducing clarity or depth.

Less noise. Same substance.

**2. Use simpler parts**

This applies to complicated systems. When writing, if you can replace a sophisticated word with a basic one, do it.

When coding, if you can reuse an existing function instead of building a new complex one, do it.

Simple building blocks make strong structures.

**3. Not doing it**

Sometimes the simplest solution is avoidance. Warren Buffett often says he avoids businesses he does not understand. If something is unnecessarily complex and you have the option not to engage with it, that may be the sound decision.

Another option is postponing it until you discover a simpler approach. Complexity often signals that you do not yet see the right angle.

While practicing simplicity, be careful. Make sure your simplification reduces complexity but does not reduce depth. Removing friction is good. Removing substance is not.

### Practice

Think of a task you are doing today. It could be:
- Designing something new
- Explaining an idea
- Giving a presentation
- Writing a class or function
- Researching a concept

Ask yourself:

- How can this be simplified?
- What parts can be removed while keeping the meaning the same?
- What parts can be replaced with simpler alternatives?
- Can I postpone this until I find a simpler way?
- Can I avoid doing this altogether?

### Examples

#### Example-1: Writing an Email

You draft a long email explaining a project update. It includes background information, repeated points, and extra details.

By applying simplicity, you remove repeated explanations and unnecessary context. You reduce the email to three clear bullet points:
- What was done
- What is next
- What is needed
  
The message becomes easier to read and harder to misunderstand.

#### Example-2: Building a Fitness Routine

You create a complex workout plan with different exercises for every muscle group each day. It becomes difficult to follow consistently.

Instead, you simplify it to a basic structure:
- Push
- Pull
- Legs

Fewer decisions. Same effectiveness. Higher consistency.

#### Example-3: Explaining an Idea

You try to explain a new business idea using technical jargon and advanced terminology. People nod but do not fully understand.

You simplify it into one sentence:

“We help small businesses automate customer follow-ups so they don’t lose sales.”

Now it is clear, memorable, and actionable.

#### Other

_"An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity. A physicist tries to make it simple; an idiot, anything the more complicated is, the more he will admire it. If you make something so clusterfucked he can't understand it, he's gonna think you're a god cause you made it so complicated nobody can understand it_."
