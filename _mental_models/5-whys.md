#### Description

By asking "why" multiple times, we can gain a deeper understanding of the root causes behind a high-level problem.

The goal is to land on a what or a how.

#### Practice

1. Identify an action or a problem (something you have done or plan to do).
2. Ask "why?"
3. Provide an answer.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach a root cause.

#### Example-1

1. I want to visit my mom every week.
2. 
 - Why do I want to visit my mom every week?
 - Because I feel like she is going to pass away and I don't want to regret not being with her enough.
3. 
 - Why do I feel like I will regret that I wasn't with her enough?
 - Because I feel like I need to make up for it.
4. 
 - Why do I feel like I need to make up for it?
 - Because I've avoided her and acted bad towards her all my childhood.
5. 
 - Why did I avoid her and act poorly toward her throughout my childhood?
 - Because I wanted to explore my sexuality, but she was so controlling that I felt I couldn't.

 A1. 
 
 - Why was she so controlling? 
 - Because she was afraid that I would get pregnant.
 
 A2. 
 
 - Why was she afraid that I would get pregnant?
 - Because she never taught me anything about how sexuality works.

 A3. 
 
 - Why didn't she teach that subject?
 - Because she was raised in a society that forbade such talk.

 B1. 
 
 - Why did I want to explore my sexuality?
