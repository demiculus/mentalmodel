summary: We occasionally get stuck in a loop where we non-stop simulate an interaction. Planning something once is okay but non-stop is unhealthy.

## Description

This mental model is for people who often find themselves constantly simulating interactions — what they are going to do on a date, how the conversation with their boss or principal will go, or what they should have said instead of the blabber they delivered.

Mental simulation is useful. But when these simulations become unconscious, repetitive, and obsessive, they stop being preparation and start becoming rumination. At that point, they are unhealthy and a waste of time.

The goal is not to eliminate simulation. The goal is to notice when it becomes excessive — and stop it.

Being present requires awareness. Overplanning often feels productive, but in reality it is just repeated mental rehearsal without action.

## Practice

- Intentionally imagine yourself in a future conversation.
- Run a short mental simulation of how it might go.
- Then deliberately stop the imagination.
- Bring your attention back to your current surroundings — your breathing, your posture, the sounds around you.

Practicing this on purpose increases your awareness of when these thought patterns start running automatically.

When you notice yourself overplanning in daily life, interrupt it.
Return to the present moment.

Preparation is useful.

Repetition without control is not.
