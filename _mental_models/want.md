## Description

Our mind isn't linear, there are many moving parts and different incentives. This is why it's usually not as clear as we want it to.

For example: When it comes to work, a part of us might want online work, yet, another part wants close social interactions. While another part wants extended focus time, the other wants to manage people.

This is usually the case for any complex system, such as relationships, family dynamics, school, or hobbies.

This practice increases our skills in clarifying our needs.

## Practice

Get a practice journal: it can be an online notepad or a physical notebook. Write down the following everyday for the next 30 days

1. Date
2. "What do I want?"
3. Write the first thing that comes to your mind.
4. “Why?"
5. Write as many reasons as you can think of. 
6. If you decide to change your answer, you can continue from Step 2.

### Example-1
1. October 2, 2020
2. What do I want?
3. To have a stable life
4. Why?
5. Because I am tired from moving around lately. I want some certainty in my life.

### Example-2
1. October 3, 2020
2. What do I want?
3. To be financially stable
4. Why?
5. Because I want to be able to buy the things that I want without worrying about my future.

### Example-3
1. October 4, 2020
2. What do I want?
3. To have a job that I enjoy doing
4. Why?
5. Because I am tired of working, but I need money so I want to be able to work and have fun with it at the same time.
