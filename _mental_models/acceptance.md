#### Description

We all have negative emotions, and most of the time, these emotions arise from our expectations not matching reality. So, instead of changing reality, we can change our expectations, and these emotions will cease to exist. For that, we either need to understand the reason why bad events are happening or understand that there are reasons why they happened that we may not know.

#### Practice

1. Think of a time when you had a negative emotion
2. Write down an acceptance sentence for it

Repeat this 4 times every day.

#### Examples

- Jealous of my boyfriend: I don't like it when I see other people have a close relationship with my partner, and it is normal for me to be jealous of him. I love him, and I don't want to share him. This feeling is totally natural.

- Anger towards my partner: Sometimes, my partner does things that piss me off, and it is normal for me to be angry towards my partner. We are not the same person, and we won't have the same idea 100% of the time. When our ideas differ, we can talk it out. Sometimes, I lose control and get angry, but that's okay. I am human, after all.

- Shame at the swimming pool: I didn't feel good taking off my shirt. I was not comfortable with my body, and that's normal. Society and ads have trained my mind to think that everyone needs to have a nice body and thus made me feel this way. It's wrong, but rewiring my mind and accepting my body will take time, and I can continue feeling some shame until I learn to accept my body as it is.

- Doubts about new business partner: I have my doubts about her. I don't know if it will work out, and it is normal for me to feel this way. I have been running away from commitments and group work all my life, and so I haven't had enough experience working with other people.

- Impatience with others: Some people don't do things the way I do, and it is normal for me to feel impatience toward them. We all have different mindsets and ideas, and that's okay

- Feeling misunderstood: I hate it when people misinterpret my intentions, and it's normal for me to feel bad about it. People see things differently, and as long as I know that my intentions are clear, I have nothing to be ashamed of.
