### Description

**Goal**: A specific outcome we want to achieve within a certain time frame.
- _Example_: Do 100 pushups within one month.

**Aim**: A direction we want to move toward.
- _Example_: Develop stronger arms.

When we set a goal, we make many hidden assumptions. We assume our body, schedule, mental state, relationships, and environment are aligned in a way that allows us to achieve that goal within the given timeframe. 

However, we rarely know if those assumptions are true.

What we do create, though, are expectations. Those expectations often generate anxiety in situations such as:
- Falling behind schedule
- Realizing the goal is too ambitious
- Comparing ourselves to others

This anxiety increases the likelihood that we will change, postpone, or abandon the goal entirely. That is why smaller goals tend to have higher completion rates than larger ones

Goals can be psychologically dangerous when they create pressure and identity attachment. Instead, we can replace rigid goals with **aims**.

An aim is simply a direction. It does not demand a deadline. It does not create unnecessary stress. It simply points us forward.

To move toward our aims, we build **processes**.

By using **Aim + Process** instead of rigid goals, we reduce the negative side effects (anxiety, burnout, quitting) while keeping the positives:
- Continuous improvement
- Momentum
- Good feeling when we reach a milestone
- Milestones that feel rewarding

**Note1**: A process is a `small, consistent set of actions`. If the process is too hard, it becomes just another goal in disguise.

**Note2**: If you stop following your process, it means the process is too demanding. 

Reduce it.

If your process includes 30 minutes of exercise daily and you stop doing it, reduce it to 10 minutes.

If 10 minutes is still too much, reduce it to 5.

If needed, reduce it to 1 minute.

The compounding effect of doing 5 minutes daily is far more powerful than pushing 30 minutes for a week and then quitting.

Consistency beats intensity.

#### Awareness of Goals

1. Think of a goal you currently have or previously had.
2. Think about your achievement status

#### Replacing Goals

#### Practice

1. Write down a specific goal you want to achieve.
2. Replace it with a broader aim (a direction).
3. Create a small, sustainable process that moves you toward that aim.

#### Example-1

**Goal**: I want to do 50 pushups.

**Aim**: I want to have stronger arms

**Process**
- Do 10 minutes of pushup exercises 6 days a week.
- Spend 10 minutes researching better pushup techniques on the 7th day.

#### Example-2

**Goal**: I want to earn $5,000 in passive income.

**Aim**: I want to build more income-generating assets.

**Process**
- Work on side projects for 20 minutes every day.
- Spend one session per week learning about monetization strategies.

#### Example-3

**Goal**: I want to read 30 books this year.

**Aim**: I want to become more knowledgeable and thoughtful.

**Process**
- Read 5 pages every day.
- Replace 10 minutes of scrolling with reading before bed.
