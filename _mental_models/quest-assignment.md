## Description

Games can generally be categorized into two types:

1. Theme park
2. Sandbox

Theme park games guide the player step by step through a predefined experience. [Candy crush](https://i.redd.it/u25jttpjhgi01.jpg) is a good example. The levels are structured, the objectives are clear, and the player simply progresses from one stage to the next without deciding what to do beyond completing the next level.

Sandbox games are different. The player is placed in an open world and must decide what they want to pursue. _Minecraft_ is a good example. The player can build a village, explore caves, fight enemies, automate farms, or simply wander. The game provides tools — not direction.

Our society resembles a theme park.

Parents tell us what to eat, what to wear, and how to behave.

Schools tell us what to study and how to study.

Jobs tell us what tasks to complete and how to measure success.

Much of life is pre-structured. As long as we follow the track, we rarely need to make deep decisions. When most quests are externally assigned, we rarely develop the skill of assigning our own quests. The ability to create your own direction — your own missions — is a skill. And like any skill, it must be practiced.
 

#### Practice 1: 

Play sandbox games. Some notable examples include: Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto, Garry's Mod, Roblox, Kerbal Space Program, The Sims, [Dawn of Crafting](https://www.dawnofcrafting.com/). 

It is even more effective if you choose a large open-world or MMO-style game. The number of decisions and interactions you can make increases dramatically. Pay attention to how you decide what to do next. That is the skill you are training.

#### Practice 2: 

1. Write down a specific area of your life. (Examples: job, school, love, relationships, health, diet, cleaning, computer usage, commute.)
2. Break that area into smaller elements
3. Ask yourself how you decided on each element.
Was it your decision — or something inherited from someone else?

#### Example 1: 

**Cleaning dishes**

I scrub dishes thoroughly because my mom used to do it that way.

But do I actually need to scrub that intensely?

Do I need to wash a glass every single time I use it?

Could I simply rinse and reuse it if it’s only been used for water?

#### Example 2:

**Job**

I’m making games and coding.

I started making games because my brother wanted to make games, and I didn’t have a better idea at the time.

Is this something I truly wanted — or something I adopted?

When it comes to coding, I felt compelled to learn it because I love creating things, and coding is a powerful creation tool. But what I truly love is creation, not necessarily coding itself.

Since I have enough capital, I could hire developers and focus on the creative direction instead.

Maybe my real quest is “create,” not “code.”

#### Example 3:

**Fitness Routine**

I go to the gym and lift weights because everyone says that’s what you’re supposed to do to stay fit.

But do I actually enjoy lifting weights?
Or do I enjoy movement, competition, or being outdoors?

Maybe I would prefer martial arts, rock climbing, swimming, or playing a team sport.

Perhaps I’m following the default “fitness quest” instead of designing my own version of health.
