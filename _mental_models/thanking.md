## Description

Sincere appreciation increases the likelihood of other people repeating similar actions. It also increases the likelihood of us receiving similar actions in return.

Gratitude strengthens relationships. It raises overall happiness — both in us and around us.

When appreciation is expressed genuinely and specifically, it reinforces positive behavior. People naturally move toward environments where they feel valued.

## Practice

- Think of someone you interacted with in the past day.
- Think of something that person did or said that you appreciated.
- Send them a short message thanking them for that specific thing.
- If you want, tell them what you are practicing and share this idea with them.

Keep it simple. Keep it sincere. Be specific.
