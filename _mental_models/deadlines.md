#### Description

Making tough decisions are hard. People are inclined to avoid or procrastinate rather than make a decision. Putting an artificial deadline in place forces your mind to reach a decision within the set timeframe.

#### Practice

Whenever there's a to-do, set an artificial deadline and do your best to enforce it. Train your mind to think, _"I must have a decision by this time._" If you can't make a decision now, the interim decision should be, _"I will figure it out by this specific time/day."_

#### Example-1

You need to decide whether or not to hire a candidate. After due diligence, you believe he fits the criteria, but you feel as though something is missing that you can't yet identify. Instead of deciding right away, set a deadline. _"By 6pm on Monday, I'll make a decision."_ At five minutes to 6:00, you probably don't have the answer but within those final five minutes, something clicks -- and by 6:00pm the answer is there. 

#### Example-2

On Monday - your friend asks you to go out on Saturday. You miss hanging out with your friend, but you also want to spend time working on pending tasks. Instead of over-committing or declining right away, set a deadline. _"By Thursday 5pm, I will make a decision."_ This will give you time to rethink and see if you can get things done. By Thursday morning, you have already finished your pending tasks. By 5 p.m., you can confidently decide whether or not to go out. 

#### Example-3

You receive two job offers from Company A and B. Both were promising, making it difficult to decide which one to accept. Both offer the same compensation, and have great feedback. You set a deadline, _"By 9pm on Monday, I will make a decision."_ A few minutes before 9pm, something clicks and you suddenly feel like you want to join Company A. 


Making a decision often causes anxiety due to the fear of making the wrong one. By setting a clear deadline for yourself, your mind is trained to actually reach a conclusion. You will eventually realize that whichever decision you choose is the one you always wanted; you were just afraid of regret. Over time, this will help you let go of anxiety and make decisions more easily.
