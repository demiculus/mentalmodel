## Description

Running a mental simulation before doing something makes it much easier to accomplish.

When you mentally rehearse an action, your brain becomes familiar with it. The unknown becomes known. Resistance decreases. What once felt intimidating starts to feel procedural.

## Practice

1. Write a **SMALL** goal you wish to achieve. 
2. Close your eyes and imagine yourself taking all the steps from your current situation to the moment you achieve your goal.
3. Visualize the details: movements, sensations, environment, and possible obstacles.

#### Example-1

**Taking a Cold Shower**

Close your eyes and imagine:
- Taking off your clothes.
- Picking up your towel.
- Walking to the shower.
- Hanging the towel.
- Turning the handle to cold.
- Feeling the water hit your head.
- Your shoulders.
- Your chest and back.
- Your legs.

When you visualize it for two minutes, doing the real thing becomes much easier. The shock feels expected rather than surprising.

#### Example-2

**Approaching Someone You Find Attractive**

Close your eyes and imagine:
- Standing up.
- Walking toward them.
- Saying “Hi” and smiling.
- Hearing them say hi back.
- Introducing yourself while offering your hand.

Also imagine possible outcomes. For example, they might say, “Oh, I have a boyfriend.”

You smile and respond calmly, “Have a good evening. He’s a lucky guy.”
You walk away composed.

By visualizing both success and rejection, you remove uncertainty. The fear decreases because you have already experienced it in your mind.

#### Example-3

**Giving a Presentation**

Close your eyes and imagine:
- Opening your laptop.
- Connecting it to the screen.
- Standing in front of the room.
- Beginning your first sentence clearly.
- Clicking through the slides.
- Imagine stumbling on a word — and smoothly correcting yourself.
- Imagine finishing and hearing applause.

After mentally rehearsing, the real presentation feels like a repeat rather than a first attempt.
