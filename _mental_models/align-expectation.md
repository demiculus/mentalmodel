#### Description

Problems tend to arise when we fail to clearly align expectations with others. Such problems can be avoided if we foresee potential issues and proactively tell the other person what to expect. Communication errors usually stem from incorrect assumptions. This process is reciprocal: we can align others' expectations, just as they can align ours. It is our responsibility to make sure both our expectations and those of others are aligned. It is unrealistic to think everyone will do a good job at this, so it is our responsibility to take control.

#### Practice:

- Think of something you’ve recently told someone. Is there any detail you left out? Is there information they lack that might make the situation clearer for them?
- Think of a collaborative task. If any part is not clear, ask them to align your expectations. 
- Which parties might be affected by the process or the result? Let them know.

#### Example-1 -> Aligning others' expectations

Situation: When inviting guests over, assuming they like the same food as we do creates a high chance of conflict.

Communication: Hey guys, I'm going to cook X, Y, and Z. Let me know if anyone has dietary restrictions or preferences.

#### Example-2 -> Aligning others' expectations

Situation: Going to the spa with a friend. One friend might view it as an opportunity to relax in peace without talking.

Communication: By the way, I feel like just relaxing and meditating today, so I’ll mostly be quiet and close my eyes while we’re there.

#### Example-3 -> Aligning others' expectations

Situation: A new hire doesn’t know when they will meet the rest of the team or how the onboarding process will unfold.

Communication: Hey, over the next 2 weeks I will set up calls occasionally introducing you to different team members. The specific days aren't set yet, but Tuesday or Wednesday nights will likely work. Until then, you can continue the work with me & Sam. You'll slowly start working with others after 1 month.

#### Example-4 -> Others aligning our expectations

Situation: I’m waiting for someone to complete a task so I can make a decision. 

Communication: Hey, can you help align my expectations on when this will be finished? Can you give me a range—a best-case and worst-case ETA?

#### Example-5 -> Others aligning our expectations

Situation: I don't know the headcount, so I'm unsure how much food to prepare.

Communication: Hey, can you give me a guest count estimate so I can prepare food accordingly?


#### Example-6 -> Others aligning our expectations

Situation: Someone wants a task completed**, but since I don't know its urgency, I'm unsure how to prioritize it.

Communication: Hey, can you tell me how urgent this is? I currently have these three tasks: A (5 hours), B (25 hours), and C (15 hours).

In this example, I am aligning time expectations for each task while simultaneously requesting prioritization.
